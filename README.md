## 📝 Context
- Built entirely in **V0.dev** (AI-powered design tool)  
- Explores branding, colors, and animation concepts  
- Used as part of my **INFO7375: Branding & AI** coursework

## 💡 About This Site

This isn’t your average "scroll-and-forget" portfolio.

I designed it to be:
- **Visually punchy** – with custom colors (`#0E0E0E`, `#BC9862`, `#DAC5A7`)
- **Fully responsive** – looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Fun & interactive** – hover effects, scroll animations, animated badges
- **Built with components** using:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - ShadCN UI

Sections included:
- 🔥 Hero – attention-grabbing entrance with animation
- 🚀 Projects – my coolest builds with fun interactions
- 🧰 Skills – tools I love (hello, Pega, Midjourney, Airtable, etc.)
- 🏆 Certifications – flipping cards, because why not
- 💌 Contact – friendly, functional, and ready to connect
